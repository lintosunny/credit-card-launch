# Credit Card Launch Analytics
Identify and profile the most promising customer segments using available demographic and financial data. 

This project is divided into 2 parts. Finding the target market and A/B Testing for the credit card launch

## Phase 1: Find the Target Market
Target Group: Ages 18-25

**Payment Preferences**: Unlike other age groups where credit cards are the dominant payment method, for 18-25-year-olds, credit cards rank fourth with only 7.51% usage. Around 70% prefer mobile payment apps such as PhonePe and Google Pay.

**Possible Reasons**: Lower annual income and credit scores in this age group likely contribute to low credit card usage. This is supported by the fact that 61.9% of this group are freelancers.

**Purchase Categories**: 80% of purchases fall into Fashion & Apparel, Electronics, and Beauty & Personal Care.

**Preferred Marketplaces**: 55% of users shop mainly on Amazon or Flipkart.

## Phase 2: A/B Testing
